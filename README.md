## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I've learned as I grow.
The overall structure is going to be inspired from the second-brain systems used with programs like Obsidian.
For the past few days I have been brainstorming on the design process.

The idea is to convey information in a way that is intuitive.
Not only displaying information in a well written blog post, but also working with media to express nuances words can't really convey.
We'll see how that works out.

The second piece of this project will be purely technical.
Building skills in:
- Github Action workflows
- Web design with analytics in mind
- Manually configuring everything in a local environment, then learning how to use devcontainers to maintain those configurations across devices.
- basically becoming a better programmer and creator

Of course this would undoubtedly eventually catch the fancy of a well respected, charismatic and absolute genius (big wrinkly brained) employer.

But I guess I have to settle for the love and passion of being a nerd instead, no big deal. 
It's not like networking and being an actual member of society would be more effective than this five step plan to enlightenment approach.
