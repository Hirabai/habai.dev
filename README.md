# habai.dev

The idea is to create a blog page using tools that I want to learn.

I kept on getting frustrated with high level abstractions while learning how to program with vs and vscode, which then led me to look into neovim and devcontainers.

I took some time learning other things unrelated to programming, but joining a skool community called Kubercraft has led me back to these tools, and so now I am digging deeper into the command line.

While I figure my stuff out and figure out how to design a pipeline for this project, I wish to commit more often. Gotta make the commit log look impressive one way or another lol
