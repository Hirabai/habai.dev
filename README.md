## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I've learned as I grow.
The overall structure is going to be inspired from the second-brain systems used with programs like Obsidian.
For the past few days I have been brainstorming on the design process.

So far I've been:
- learning how to actually build script files for generative animations
- got into hyprland a bit
- basic things like how I could use a parser in here and whatnot
- Also structure wise, currently reading "How to take smart notes" by Sonke Ahrens and I'm trying to expand on this concept with this project.
