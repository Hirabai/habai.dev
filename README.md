## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I learn as I grow.

The overall structure is going to be inspired from personal management systems used to keep track of large amounts of notes.
The idea is to turn the good notes into html pages, and then use a bunch of nice graphic libraries to convey the information in whatever way I want.
There is no personal stress for this project because the overarching purpose is for me to practice providing *quality* work for myself.


Learning things like:
- how to actually build scripts on my own for models and animations
- I'm setting up my dev linux environment on the side, getting to understand more about how computers work under the hood.
- cool tools like parsers and transcoders
- As well as digital design. 

## Resources as of August
- This video's presentation and approach by Marius Ballot is top notch [Procedural 3D Data Trees in Three.js â€“ A Shader & Geometry Breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of-s4o0EhhI)
- As well as his website demo [Procedural Growing Structure](https://procedural-growing-structure.netlify.app/)
- And this [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) by  Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe

## Acknowledgements for this learning process
- The Kubercraft community from the Google Skool platform has been one of the life-savers of my self-taught journey. I've visited many communities while teachning myself computer science, and this is the only one that helped me really understand how to structure my approach to self-learning. Kudos to Mischa for creating this community.
