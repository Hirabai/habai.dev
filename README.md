## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I've learned as I grow.
The overall structure is going to be inspired from the second-brain systems used with programs like Obsidian.
For the past few days I have been brainstorming on the design process.

The idea is to convey information in a way that is intuitive.
Not only displaying information in a well written blog post, but also working with media to express nuances words can't really convey.
We'll see how that works out.
