## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I learn as I grow.
The overall structure is going to be inspired from personal management systems used to keep track of large amounts of notes.
Still in brainstorming phase, but as a heads up I've been going over the fundamentals again.

Learning things like:
- how to actually build scripts on my own for models and animations
- I'm setting up my dev linux environment of the side, getting to understand more about the "behind the scenes" in programming
- cool tools like parsers and transcoders
- Also structure wise, currently reading "How to take smart notes" by Sonke Ahrens and I'm trying to expand on the slip-box concept structure.
