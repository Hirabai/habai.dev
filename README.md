# habai.dev

The idea is to create a blog page using tools that I want to learn.

I kept on getting frustrated with high level abstractions while learning how to program with microsoft visual studio and vscode, which then led me to look into neovim and devcontainers.

I took some time learning other things unrelated to programming, but joining a skool community called Kubercraft has led me back to these tools, and so now I am digging deeper into the command line.

A lot of the commits I will be making in the beginning are going to be confusing, but simply staying consistent is my goal for this project.

Gotta make the commit log look impressive one way or another lol
