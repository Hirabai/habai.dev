## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I learn.

The idea is to create practical diagrams using html and other neat graphic libraries.
There is no agency for this project because the overarching purpose is for me to practice providing *quality* work for myself.


Learning things like:
- how  models and animations work under the hood.
- I'm setting up my linux environment, learning vim, bash, configuring my dotfiles. That sort of thing.
- Practicing showing up and being consistent.

## News Update as of now
Been working these past few months. Decided to cleanup and give an update..

## Acknowledgements for this learning process
- The Kubercraft community from the Google Skool platform has been one of the life-savers of my self-taught journey. I've visited many communities while teachning myself computer science, and this is the only one that helped me really understand how to structure my approach to self-learning.
