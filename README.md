## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I learn as I grow.
The overall structure is going to be inspired from personal management systems used to keep track of large amounts of notes.
Still in brainstorming phase, but as a heads up I've been going over the fundamentals again.

Learning things like:
- how to actually build scripts on my own for models and animations
- I'm setting up my dev linux environment of the side, getting to understand more about the "behind the scenes" in programming
- cool tools like parsers and transcoders
- Also structure wise, currently reading "How to take smart notes" by Sonke Ahrens and I'm trying to expand on the slip-box concept structure.

# Some behind-the-scene brainstorming

```
The process looks like:
- A question, problem, or goal needing an answer, what can be considered a "plot-hole" (when thinking about writing stories) or an "edge case" (thinking of it like a startup)
- Research into that topic or goal. Create a mind map around it using modern personal information systems.
- Understanding all of that information, then working on a writing process to organize it into something others can comprehend.
  Ways to improve comprehension for yourself includes:
  - vocational practice. Speaking out the material and recording yourself. Listening to the recordings at your leizure.
  - writing it down while reading, in fact using the approach in  "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sonke Ahrens, writing down should be the baseline for information management.
- Once done we would have a satisfiable answer to the original goal mentioned.

This conclude a very basic structure for production where an idea or goal was processed into an answer. 
```

```
# Aims at a subject, either a personal story or a no-bullshit approach at a subject. Using referrences or first-hand accounts.
# Explaining from understanding, use of media to practice comprehension.
# Three.js has some cool features that allows for really neat and novel website layouts.
```

## Resources as of july
- [How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502) by SÃ¶nke Ahrens
- [Lecture 3 - Before the Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ) a YC lecture given by Paul Graham, he mentioned the "edge case" concept and I'm trying to connect it to content creation or plot-structures in storytelling.
  The reason why storytelling is so effective in brand and marketing is because they resonate with people, and business is about people.
