## What is this project about?
This project is going to be a website that will display what I learn as I grow.

The overall structure is going to be inspired from personal management systems used to keep track of large amounts of notes.
The idea is to turn the good notes into html pages, and then use a bunch of nice graphic libraries to convey the information in whatever way I want.
There is no personal stress for this project because the overarching purpose is for me to practice providing *quality* work for myself.


Learning things like:
- how to actually build scripts on my own for models and animations
- I'm setting up my dev linux environment on the side. How to configure all my software tools from scratch.
- cool tools like parsers and transcoders
- I am passionate about designing with data, so using telemitry is on the agenda.

## Resources as of September
I'm taking this month to just focus on making money, so there won't be much progress.

## Acknowledgements for this learning process
- The Kubercraft community from the Google Skool platform has been one of the life-savers of my self-taught journey. I've visited many communities while teachning myself computer science, and this is the only one that helped me really understand how to structure my approach to self-learning.
